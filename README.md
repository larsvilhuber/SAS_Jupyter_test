# SAS_Jupyter_test

My first test with the [SAS kernel](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas_kernel) for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/).

Note that you can't view this on Github (like you could if it were running Python), because of course Github does not have a subscription to SAS... See [SAS_Jupyter_test.md]().
