# SAS_Jupyter_test

My first test with the [SAS kernel](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas_kernel) for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/).

Note that you can't view this on Github (like you could if it were running Python), because of course Github does not have a subscription to SAS... See [SAS_Jupyter_test.md]().

Alternatives to using Jupyter could be as an "engine" within [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), see for instance http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~hemken/SASworkshops/SASWindows/Markdown/SASmarkdown.html.
